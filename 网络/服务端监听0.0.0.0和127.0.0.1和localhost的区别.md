## 服务端监听0.0.0.0和127.0.0.1和localhost的区别

127.0.0.1 is normally the IP address assigned to the "loopback" or local-only interface. This is a "fake" network adapter that can only communicate within the same host. It's often used when you want a network-capable application to only serve clients on the same host. A process that is listening on 127.0.0.1 for connections will only receive local connections on that socket.
`127.0.0.1`是本地虚拟的Network Adapter，只用于本地通信。非局域网通信。

"localhost" is normally the hostname for the 127.0.0.1 IP address. It's usually set in /etc/hosts(or the Windows equivalent named "hosts" somewhere under %WINDIR%). You can use it just like any other hostname - try "ping localhost" to see how it resolves to 127.0.0.1.
`localhost`通常是`127.0.0.1`的别名，但只是一个配置，可能被配置为其它IP，但仅仅在`127.0.0.1`时，才表示本地网络。

0.0.0.0 has a couple of different meanings, but in this context, when a server is told to listen on 0.0.0.0 that means "listen on every available network interface". The loopback adapter with IP address 127.0.0.1 from the perspective of the server process looks just like any other network adapter on the machine, so a server told to listen on 0.0.0.0 will accept connections on that interface too.
`0.0.0.0`表示在所有有效的Network Adapter中监听。也即是说，这个配置也会在`127.0.0.1`下监听，也会在网卡上监听。
